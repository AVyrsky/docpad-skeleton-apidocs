<p>The <strong>Status Page</strong> is an external platform for improving communication with customers during YaaS disruptions.
It displays statuses of our services, tools, and Web sites. When one of those components are unreachable, important information is displayed on the YaaS Status Page.

Each team has a team account that can be used to manage incidents and maintenance on YaaS Status Page.

<p>We have the following YaaS Status Pages:</p>
- http://status.yaas.io/ - It displays status of our production components that are relevant for our YaaS customers.
- http://status-internal.yaas.io/ - It displays status of our production components that are relevant only for internal use. For example cloud foundry infrastructure.
- http://status.stage.yaas.io/ - It displays status of our stage components.

You manage each of them here: https://manage.statuspage.io/
If there is some component for your service/tool missing, contact Wookiee team. Don't try to add it on your own.
